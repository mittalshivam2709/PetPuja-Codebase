# PetPuja-Codebase

## Introduction
This is the codebase of a website which is similar to swiggy and zomato where one can place other for different restaurants but the difference here is there is no delivery boy assigned, the one who orders collect it on his own. This was aimed for college canteens where students place order sitting in their hostel rooms and libraries and the payement is done at the time of ordering itself so as to facilitate vendors. 

## Functionalities 

We have 2 type of ids that one can create first is the student id and second is for canteen. 
Students can order food after logging in and going to the order now page which can be seen in the navigation bar. There they can find all the canteens and the have to select the canteen for which they want to order. After selecting the canteen, the webpage will show the list of food items available and the students are supposed to select the quantity for the same and pay for it. Once the paymnet is done they are assigned a token number and they can collect their order by using this token number once the food is prepared.
One addtional thing that we are providing is the estimated time after which the order will be ready if the order needs to be prepared(like dosa and unlike samosa which is already kept prepared). 

From Canteen admin's point of view we are having an orders page which shows the current pending orders of the customers. We also have a stocks page where the admin can update the stock at the beginning of the day or whenever he wants. We also have an option of adding a new dish to this page. 

## Work done so far
We are done with the frontend of all the pages. 
For backend we are done with the login page,signup page and (partially)order now page for students. We are not done with the orders page and the stocks page for the vendors which can be done using similar methods used so far in the backend.
